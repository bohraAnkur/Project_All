# Building your Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step
- We will implement your first Recurrent Neural Network in Numpy .

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have "memory". They can read inputs  x⟨t⟩x⟨t⟩  (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a uni-directional RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional RNN can take context from both the past and the future.

- Learn about recurrent neural networks. This type of model has been proven to perform extremely well on temporal data. It has several variants including LSTMs, GRUs and Bidirectional RNNs, which you are going to learn about in this section.
