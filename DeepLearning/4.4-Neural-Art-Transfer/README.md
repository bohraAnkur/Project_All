# Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style TransferÂ¶
- We will learn about Neural Style Transfer. 
- This algorithm was created by Gatys et al. (2015) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

## Objectives
- Implement the neural style transfer algorithm
- Generate novel artistic images using your algorithm
- Most of the algorithms you've studied optimize a cost function to get a set of parameter values. In Neural Style Transfer, we'll optimize a cost function to get pixel values!
