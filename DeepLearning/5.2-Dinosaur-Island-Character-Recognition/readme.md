# Dinosaur Island - Character-Level Language Modeling
- Ww will build a character level language model to generate new names. Our algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. 


## Objectives
- How to store text data for processing using an RNN
- How to synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit
- How to build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network
  Why clipping the gradients is important
