# Residual Networks 

- We will learn how to build very deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets). 
- In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by He et al., allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.

## Objectives 

- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets.
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.
- Keras will be employed for Implementation
