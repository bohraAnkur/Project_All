# Operations on word vectors 
- Word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train, most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings.

## Objectives
- Load pre-trained word vectors, and measure similarity using cosine similarity
- Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to __.
- Modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias
- Let's get started! Run the following cell to load the packages you will need.
