# Machine Learning Ex7 K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

## Summary Of the Project: 
-In this exercise, we will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. 

-In the second part ,we will use Principal Component Analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
