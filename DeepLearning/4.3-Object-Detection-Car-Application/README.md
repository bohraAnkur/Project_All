# Autonomous driving - Car detection
- We will learn about object detection using the very powerful YOLO model.
- Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: 
- Redmon et al., 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242).

## Objectives
- Use object detection on a car detection dataset
- Deal with bounding boxes
- Run the following cell to load the packages and dependencies that are going to be useful for your journey!
