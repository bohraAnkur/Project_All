Good job with the with the short main method.  

Info class has many strong dependencies: -1  

Javadocs should be more descriptive: -2  

What if args[i++] isnt an address in the path: core: 121 : -2  

Write more meaningful error messages: -1  

Core does too many tasks: -1  

hardcoded error messages line 173 core: -1  

Skip the first line line 173/174 instead of checking again and again  

Error messages should be in exceptions and not SysOut: -1  

Write to a directory instead of writing to the home directory  

if-else in individual info, get 46, no documentation as well, too much coupling on the enum: -1  


Total: 150/160
