Good work with the iterator abstractions.  

In iterators next() returns an object, should have returned the IbstNode/Ibst: -2  

inOrderNext() and postOrderNext() methods not expected, the iterators should just have next()
method and based on the type of iterator, it should return the inorder next or postorder next : -5  


could have used keySets() for aliases, but duplicated the dataset: -1  

Total: 132/140
